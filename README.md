bin-raider
==========
One of the most frustrating concepts of *nix systems is the organization (or lack thereof) when it comes to programs installed. You can get a list of software installed, but most users cannot differentiate important programs from the mess returned. bin-raider compiles the list as described, but then it adds a description and groups the programs into categories to be more easily viewed.
